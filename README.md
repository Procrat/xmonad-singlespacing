# XMonad.Layout.SingleSpacing

A very simple XMonad extension that adds spacing between windows, but unlike the
one available in [xmonad-contrib](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib)
([XMonad.Layout.Spacing](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib/blob/master/XMonad/Layout/Spacing.hs)),
it doesn't add those spacing twice.
