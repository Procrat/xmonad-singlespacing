# XMonad.Layout.SingleSpacing

A very simple XMonad extension that adds spacing between windows, but unlike the
one available in [xmonad-contrib](http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/)
([XMonad.Layout.Spacing](http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Layout-Spacing.html)),
it doesn't add those spacing twice.
