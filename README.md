# XMonad.Layout.SingleSpacing

A very simple [XMonad](http://xmonad.org) extension that adds spacing between
windows, but unlike the one available in
[xmonad-contrib](http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/)
([XMonad.Layout.Spacing](http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Layout-Spacing.html)),
it doesn't add that spacing twice.
